Practical ES6 Examples.

## ASYNC BLOG REQUIRE DEFINE

* What does it ShowCase?
  - Async Blog is an example built with ES6 generators and async await. Generator functions provide a very clean interface for this example CLI App.
  - Require Define is a perfect example of the usefulness of the ES6 Class Syntax, using the class syntax we can succinctly define and utilize the singleton pattern. This lets us build our own require and define functions.

* Running the App
  - npm start runs the process that defines the async blog cli.

* Test Suite
  - npm test runs the test suite for both the async_blog and the require_define example.
  - npm run testAsync runs the test suite for the async blog.
  - npm run testRequire runs the test suite for the require define problem.
